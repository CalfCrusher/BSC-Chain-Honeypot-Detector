# BSC Honeypot Detector

A Python script that analyzes BEP-20 tokens on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to detect honeypot characteristics using multiple detection techniques.

## Features

The detector performs the following checks:

1. **Basic Token Information** - Retrieves name, symbol, decimals, and total supply
2. **Ownership Analysis** - Checks if ownership is renounced and owner's token holdings
3. **Bytecode Analysis** - Scans for suspicious opcodes (selfdestruct, delegatecall)
4. **Liquidity Check** - Verifies PancakeSwap liquidity pool existence and depth
5. **Transfer Restrictions** - Tests for transfer limitations or blocks
6. **Buy/Sell Simulation** - Simulates trades to detect selling restrictions and calculate slippage

## Installation

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the script with a single command-line argument:

```bash
python honeypot_detector.py --address <contract_address>
```

### Example

```bash
python honeypot_detector.py --address 0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
```

## Output

The script will:
- Display token information
- List all findings with severity levels (INFO, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- Calculate a risk score
- Provide a final verdict:
  - ‚úÖ APPEARS SAFE - Low risk detected
  - ‚ö° MEDIUM RISK - Be cautious
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è  HIGH RISK - Proceed with extreme caution
  - üö® HONEYPOT DETECTED - Do not invest!

## Exit Codes

- `0` - Token appears safe or medium risk
- `1` - High risk detected
- `2` - Honeypot detected
- `3` - Error during analysis

## Detection Techniques

### 1. Ownership Check
- Verifies if contract ownership is renounced
- Checks owner's percentage of total supply
- High owner concentration is flagged as risky

### 2. Bytecode Analysis
- Scans for dangerous opcodes that could enable backdoors
- Detects selfdestruct and delegatecall patterns

### 3. Liquidity Analysis
- Checks for liquidity pair on PancakeSwap
- Evaluates liquidity depth
- Low liquidity indicates higher risk

### 4. Buy/Sell Simulation
- Simulates buying tokens with BNB
- Simulates selling tokens back to BNB
- Calculates round-trip slippage
- Detects if selling is blocked or restricted

### 5. Transfer Restrictions
- Tests if transfer function is callable
- Identifies paused or blocked transfers

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Active internet connection
- BSC RPC endpoint access
